DEPRECATED REPO
===============
Add-ons using the APIs described in this document are considered a legacy
technology in Firefox and will be removed in Firefox 57. Don't use these
techniques to develop new add-ons - use the [WebExtensions API][] instead.
If you maintain an add-on which uses the techniques described here, consider
migrating it to use WebExtensions.

This repository sticks around for reference purposes.
